      "Selftext: Dis week our daddy is away at a conference for wurks. Mommy had nachos for dinner last night and there was  more shredded cheese leftover in the bag when she was done. She rained it down on us while we snapped it up from the air. When it was all gone from the bag she let us lick up all the cheese that made it to the floor. It had extra bonus floor flavors! We had so much funs!\n",
