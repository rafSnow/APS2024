1bcpj6s,Dimitra: Solving Deforestation with AI,"Dimitra‚Äôs proprietary artificial intelligence is delivered in the Dimitra Connected Farmer app, enhancing agricultural productivity, traceability, and compliance for producers. There are around 570 million farmers globally, millions of food producers, and 3 million cooperatives worldwide that have new regulatory reporting requirements in 2024. This mandates that they use an application like Dimitra‚Äôs Connected Farmer.

&#x200B;

Farmers download the mobile app in their native language and can immediately leverage the power of AI and blockchain in agriculture! 

&#x200B;

With just a few simple actions, producers can generate crucial reports, such as deforestation reports that are vital for complying with EUDR regulations. Farmers, food producers, and operators can leverage these reports to adhere to EUDR by identifying deforestation, mitigating fraud risks, and producing compliance certificates, all paid for with the $DMTR token.

1bd40wg,UMD community frustrated about lack of communication on tree-cutting in Guilford Woods,"The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission cut down several trees in Guilford Woods in February to repair a water main pipe, sparking frustration among University of Maryland community members who had previously advocated to protect the same land from deforestation.

Commission spokesperson Lyn Riggins said the water company cut down 11 large trees and about 30 smaller trees starting Feb. 23 after finding that a 16-foot section of a main water line in the woods was failing. The trees growing on top of the pipe needed to be removed for access, she said in an emailed statement to The Diamondback.

Community members said the commission did not give any notice before beginning the repairs, which left people like associate geology professor Nicholas Schmerr confused seeing trees in the woods that had been cut down.

‚ÄúWe were working hard to try and preserve the woods and here‚Äôs somebody out there doing something that‚Äôs taking down and damaging the environment,‚Äù Schmerr said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got to do that no matter what. But it‚Äôs a question of, ‚Äòdid they talk to the university? What was the communication?‚Äô‚Äù

Crying every day, at work, at home, in the car. Can't stop looking at pictures and reading old letters when before I couldn't bear to look at them. Losing my grip on my work productivity, making mistakes, not able to keep things together like I was. I guess its the trade off.

I tried the online grief support group thing but my son is too terrified of being left alone, lest I die, that I can't manage to sit through it. 

I did meet one person who lost their long time partner, were friends now. But even that I feel like I've become unhealthy attached. I'm terrified of losing them like I've lost everyone else in my life since he died. 

I also finally had the money to buy the urn necklace I wanted for him. The one person I told about it said it was way too expensive, but they just don't get it. His ashes are going in there. I didn't even pick out his urn, the one I bought was too small for his ashes and I was such a wreck over my parents ended up buying a replacement.

1bdma28,Multicast Flooding Issue with 100+ Apple TVs,"Hey Guys,

I am the administrator of several schools. At the school in this case, we currently have approximately 1100 mobile devices and around 100+ Apple TVs. In the current setup, there is a VLAN for each class to keep the subnets small (about 30 users per VLAN). Access control is handled through a Microsoft NPS. The Apple TVs also have their own subnets.

&#x200B;

The issue arises when we use simple multicast forwarding; the networks get flooded with multicast requests, preventing all devices from discovering all Apple TVs. In the past, we had an Avahi server that manually registered all Apple TVs and listened for multicast packets from the devices. This server could then return the complete list of Apple TVs to the client in 1 or 2 packets.

&#x200B;

My question now is: Is there a way to achieve this through the Fortigate, or do you know of other solutions to this problem? Unfortunately, I personally have limited knowledge of multicast.

&#x200B;

To anticipate a question: We want to move away from the Avahi solution because it cannot be administered by us, and I hope there is a more elegant solution to this problem, as Avahi requires many scripts and more maintenance.

&#x200B;

We are running a FGT201F on 7.0.14 with FortiManager.
